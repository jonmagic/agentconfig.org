# Voice & Tone

## Core Principles

1. **First-person narratives** with introspective framing
2. **Concrete examples** over abstract concepts
3. **Thoughtful perspective** of a principal engineer

## When Writing

- Start with context, then insight
- Use "I" statements for personal reflection
- Include specific details that ground the writing

For detailed patterns and examples, see \`references/patterns.md\`.`,

      {
        path: 'references/patterns.md',

        content: `# Voice Patterns

## Opening Lines
Start with context that draws readers in:
- "Last week, our team shipped a feature that..."
- "I've been thinking about how we approach..."
- "There's a pattern I keep seeing in..."

## Transitions
Move between ideas naturally:
- "This connects to something I learned..."
- "The interesting part is..."
- "What surprised me was..."

## Closings
End with reflection or forward-looking thought:
- "Looking back, the key insight was..."
- "Next time, I'll remember to..."
- "This changed how I think about..."`,

# Weekly Snippets

Build weekly accomplishment summaries by gathering from multiple sources.

## Related Skills

This skill works best with:
- **voice-and-tone**: Apply when drafting snippet prose
- **who-am-i**: Use for context about role and team

## Process

1. **Identify time range**
   - Friday through Thursday (standard snippet week)

2. **Gather from sources** (in order)
   - Weekly Notes file
   - GitHub PRs and issues (via \`gh\` CLI)
   - Meeting Notes folder

3. **Draft sections**
   - Ships: What you delivered
   - Risks: What might block progress
   - Blockers: What's currently blocking
   - Ideas: Improvements or proposals
   - Collaborations: Cross-team work
   - Shoutouts: Recognition for others

4. **Apply voice-and-tone**
   - Lead with business impact
   - Use active voice
   - Include specific metrics where possible

## Format Guide

See \`references/format-guide.md\` for section templates and examples.`,

## Section Templates

### Ships
\`\`\`
- **[Project Name]**: Brief description of impact
  - Specific metric or outcome
  - Link to PR/issue if relevant
\`\`\`

### Risks
\`\`\`
- **[Risk]**: Description and mitigation plan
\`\`\`

### Shoutouts
\`\`\`
- **@username**: What they did and why it mattered
\`\`\`

## Writing Tips

1. Start with the impact, not the activity
2. Use numbers when you have them
3. Link to artifacts for context
4. Keep bullets to 1-2 lines each`,

# Visual UI QA

Perform visual quality assurance on UI screenshots using multimodal analysis.

## Requirements

This skill requires multimodal (vision) capability. If your agent doesn't support image analysis natively, use the \`scripts/analyze-screenshot.sh\` script which calls a vision model via the \`llm\` CLI.

If analysis fails, inform the user:
> "I'm unable to analyze this screenshot. To enable visual analysis, install the llm CLI (https://llm.datasette.io) and run: \`scripts/analyze-screenshot.sh <image-path>\`"

## Capabilities

- Detect visual regressions between baseline and current
- Identify accessibility issues (contrast, touch targets)
- Check design consistency (spacing, alignment, colors)
- Verify responsive behavior across breakpoints

## Process

### 1. Capture or Receive Screenshot
Use \`scripts/capture-screenshot.js <url>\` or accept an image path from the user.

### 2. Analyze Visual Elements

**Layout Analysis:**
- Check alignment and spacing consistency
- Verify responsive breakpoint behavior
- Identify overflow or clipping issues

**Color & Contrast:**
- Verify WCAG contrast ratios (AA minimum)
- Check color consistency with design tokens
- Identify color blindness accessibility issues

**Typography:**
- Check font sizes meet minimum requirements
- Verify line height and letter spacing
- Identify truncation or overflow issues

### 3. Compare with Baseline (if provided)
- Pixel-level diff analysis
- Highlight changed regions
- Classify changes: intentional vs regression

### 4. Generate Report

Use template from \`assets/report-template.md\`:
- Summary of findings
- Severity classification (critical/major/minor)
- Screenshots with annotations
- Recommended fixes

## Severity Definitions

See \`references/severity-guide.md\` for classification criteria.`,

- Prevents user from completing task
- WCAG AAA contrast failure on essential content
- Broken layout that hides content
- Incorrect data display

## Major
- Significant visual regression
- WCAG AA contrast failure
- Misaligned elements that confuse flow
- Missing visual feedback for interactions

## Minor
- Small spacing inconsistencies
- Slight color variations from design
- Non-essential decorative issues
- Pixel-level differences unlikely to notice`,
